##Hash Search - Verndale Dev Test

Hash Search was created by Nicole Thurnau as a dev test for Verndale.

####Objective <br>
Hash Search allows a user to search twitter hashtags. It returns the most popular and relevant hashtags related to that search or sends the user suggestions.

####Requirements <br>
The project requirements are listed below and come from the dev test markdown:
- Create a widget that allows users to enter a word to search the twitter API for hashtags.
- If that search returns nothing, redirect the search to another API called dictionaryapi.com that returns suggestions
- Make it look nice!
- Upon completion, send back a zip file and for bonus points deploy the tool to the Cloud!
- A [trello board](https://trello.com/b/yHDD96qK/verndale-dev-test) that contains plans and to-dos
- [Wireframes](https://trello.com/b/yHDD96qK/verndale-dev-test) 

####MVP <br>
- A search bar that returns the search results from the Twitter API
- Alternate suggestions from dictionaryapi.com that return suggested searches
- An About page that describes the app
